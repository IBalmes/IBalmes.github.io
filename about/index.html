  <h1>About me</h1>
  
  <h2>Work</h2>
  
  <p>I completed my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics in the <a href="http://luth.obspm.fr/">LUTh</a> at the Observatoire de Paris,
in September 2013. Since then I am a post-doctoral researcher at the <a href="http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/">Universidade de 
SÃ£o Paulo</a>. I work mainly on cosmology, on the analysis of N-body simulations. I have also worked on time-delays in strong 
gravitational lenses.</p>
