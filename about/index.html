  <h1>About me</h1>
  
  <h2>Work</h2>
  
  <p>I completed my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics in the LUTh at the Observatoire de Paris, in September 2013. 
  Since then I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Universidade de São Paulo. I work mainly on cosmology, on the 
  analysis of N-body simulations. I have also worked on time-delays in strong gravitational lenses.</p>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  
  <!-- Theatre -->
  <!-- Voile -->
  <!-- Danse & Cirque -->
  
  <p>I love theater and have played since I was a kid. I had the chance of finding a close group of friends, which became
  an amateur theater group. They let me direct them on stage, and it has been a lot of fun! Unfortunately, I had to give this
  up while living in São Paulo.</p>  
  
  <h2>Living abroad</h2>
  
  <p>My work has led me to live on different continents. I was born and raised in France, close to Paris.
  I spent 6 months in Princeton, New Jersey, for a research project with <a href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~jstone/">
  prof. Jim Stone</a>. At the end of my masters, I was restless and wanted to experience something different, which led me to 
  spend one year in Savalou, Benin, as a high school physics teacher. It was an incredible experience, and I came back with 
  a lifetime of stories to tell, and a deeper understanding of myself. As of Nov. 2013, I have been living in São Paulo, 
  Brazil.</p>
